  <p>Hi! My name is Uzo.</p>

  <p> These are the current resources I use for learning Ruby:</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360">Chris Pine</a></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby"></a><p>
  <p> I also bookmarked:
    <p><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/">ruby doc pages</a> because having quick access to its libary is extremely useful
